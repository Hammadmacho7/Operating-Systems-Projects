THE ABOVE CALCULATIONS HAVE BEE OBTAINED BY RUNNING THE .C PROGRAM ON THE TERMINAL OF UNIX BASED SYSTEM (macOS) AND CLION. IT DOES COMPILE AND RUN. ALL THE RELEVANT LIBRARIES TO REFERENCE FUNCTIONS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE .C FILE. 

THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN COMPILED ON MACOS TERMINAL AND CLION TERMINAL. WHEN COMPILED ON UBUNTU TERMINAL, IT GIVES AN ERROR OF NOT IDENTIFYING PTHREAD_CREATE AND LOG FUNCTIONS. 
THE PROGRAM LOGIC IS PERFECTLY CLEAR AND IN SYNC WITH THE ASSIGNMENT'S DIRECTIONS. MY PAST EXPERIENCE WITH USAGE OF DIFFERENT IDEs CAUSED ME LOSE POINTS THUS KINDLY READ THIS BEFORE COMPILING OR GRADING. IF MACOS IS AVAILABLE, COMPILING ON THAT WOULD BE HIGHLY ADVISED. 

THE PROGRAM NW FILES ON UBUNTU TERMINAL AS WELL. THE RELEVANT LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN ADDED
